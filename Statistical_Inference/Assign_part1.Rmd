##Q1: 
1. Show where the distribution is centered at and compare it to the theoretical center of the distribution.
2. Show how variable it is and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
4. Evaluate the coverage of the confidence interval for 1/lambda: X¯±1.96*S/√n

```{r}
x<-replicate(10000, { rexp(40, 0.2)})
xbar<-apply(x, 2, mean)
xsd<-apply(x, 2, sd)

norm<-replicate(10000, {mean(rnorm(40,1/0.2, 1/0.2))})

plot(density(xbar))
lines(density(norm), col="darkblue")
abline(v=1/0.2, col="red", lty=1.5)
lines(density(rnorm(40000, 5, 1)))
```


###Coverage of 95% CIs
```{r}
n<-40 
pvals <- 0.95
nosim <- 10000 
coverage <- sapply(pvals, function(p) {
     phats <- replicate(nosim, { mean(rexp(n, 0.2))})
     ul <- 5 + (qnorm(0.95) *(5/sqrt(n)) )
     xxbar<-mean(ul>=phats)
})
plot(coverage)
```
